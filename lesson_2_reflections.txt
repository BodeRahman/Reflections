What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repo git creates an empty repository.i need to initialize a new repo so i can
be able to track my files and make changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is the point where files are moved into from a working directory,before committing the change to the
repository.before any file can be committed to a repo,we must first add the file to the staging area.
