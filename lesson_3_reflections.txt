When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
i will use a remote repository when i want to push my all my commit from my computer(local repo) to github.makes my work
go public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
i might pull a change manually when the change is from another person and i want it in my project.
